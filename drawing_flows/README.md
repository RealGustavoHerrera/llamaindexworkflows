# Execute with

This will draw (HTML) the execution of workflows.
We're using `ConcurrentFlow` just as an example but that means we need to import it.

`from concurrent_workflows.collecting_multi_workflow import ConcurrentFlow`

For the execution to have access to the flow, execute from the **root folder** of the project with the following command:

```
(venv) % python -m drawing_flows.main
```
